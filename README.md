# codeclubot

A discord bot made by and for ARHCODE, a small club of students who like programming at the Adriaan Roland Holst college in the Netherlands.

### Usage

For this program to work, there needs to be a .env present in the project root (`codeclubot/`). This file should contain a `TOKEN` for a discord bot, a `GUILDID` for a development server and a `CLIENTID` for a discord bot.

To start a development server: `npm run dev`

To start a production server: `npm run start`

To update all slash commands: `npm run refresh`
